## Installation Guide
Welcome to the first step in integrating Okto SDK into your project! This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- Node.js version 14.x or later (LTS version recommended)
- npm version 6.x or later (included with Node.js) or yarn version 1.22.x or later

### Installation Steps
#### 1. Create React Native app
Run the following commands in your terminal to create a new React Native project:

```bash
npx @react-native-community/cli@latest init OktoApp
cd OktoApp
``` 

#### 2. Install the Okto SDK
After navigating to your React Native project's root directory and execute one of the following commands:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install okto-sdk-react-native
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn install okto-sdk-react-native
``` 

#### 3. Verify Installation
Confirm the installation by:
1. Checking your `package.json` dependencies:
```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "okto-sdk-react-native": "^x.x.x"  // Version number will vary
  }
}
```

2. Ensuring no error messages appeared during installation

#### 4. Initialize the project
Import the SDK in your JavaScript/TypeScript files using either of these methods:

ES6+ syntax (recommended):

```js
import { OktoProvider } from 'okto-sdk-react-native';
```

For CommonJS environments:

```js
const { OktoProvider } = require('okto-sdk-react-native');
```

#### 5. Sample Usage
```js
import { OktoProvider } from 'okto-sdk-react-native';

async function swapTokens() {
  const swap = await OktoProvider.swap({
    from: 'ETH',
    to: 'USDC',
    amount: 1,
    chain: 'Ethereum',
  });
  console.log(swap.transactionHash);
}
swapTokens();
```
Run the application with the following command:

```bash
npx react-native run-ios
```

## Next Steps
Now that you've installed the SDK successfully, you can:

1. Create your an integrated wallet experience by following the [Basic Examples](https://docs.okto.tech/docs/react-sdk/example-apps/template-app) guide
2. Explore Advanced Configuration options for customization.
