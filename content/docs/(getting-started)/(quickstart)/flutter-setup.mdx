## Installation Guide
Welcome to the first step in integrating Okto SDK into your project! This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

Before starting the installation, ensure you have the following requirements:

- Flutter SDK (2.0.0 or higher) - Install Flutter
- Dart SDK (2.12.0 or higher) - Included with Flutter installation
- Development Environment:
  - Android Studio (recommended) with Flutter and Dart plugins, OR
  - Visual Studio Code with Flutter and Dart extensions
- A working Flutter project

To verify the setup, run the following command:
```bash
flutter doctor
```
All checks should return green. If not, address any issues before proceeding.



### Installation Steps
#### 1. Create Flutter App
Run the following commands in your terminal to create a Flutter app:

```bash
flutter create PATH_TO_MY_APP
cd PATH_TO_MY_APP
``` 

#### 2. Set up Google Cloud Console
1. Go to the [Google Cloud Console](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?pli=1&project=gen-lang-client-0123862013).
2. Follow our [Google Authentication Setup Guide](https://console.cloud.google.com/welcome?pli=1&project=gen-lang-client-0123862013) to create a new project and obtain the necessary credentials.
Choose one of the following commands based on your package manager:

#### 3. Add Dependencies
Add the Okto SDK to your project's dependencies in the pubspec.yaml file:

```yaml
dependencies:  
	flutter:    
  	sdk: flutter  
 
  google_sign_in: ^6.2.1  
  flutter_dotenv: ^5.1.0  
  okto_flutter_sdk: ^0.0.15  
  cupertino_icons: ^1.0.6
```

#### 4. Install Dependencies
Execute the following command in your project's root directory:

```bash
flutter pub get
```

#### 5. Verify Installation
To confirm successful installation:

1. Check your `pubspec.lock` file for the `okto_flutter_sdk` entry
2. Verify the version matches your specified version
3. Ensure no error messages appeared during installation

#### 6. Import the SDK

```dart
import 'package:okto_sdk/okto_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  final okto = Okto(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
}
```

#### 7. Sample Usage
```dart
import 'package:okto_sdk/okto_sdk.dart';

void main() {
  final okto = Okto(apiKey: 'YOUR_API_KEY');
}

void swapTokens() async {
  final swap = await okto.swap(
    from: 'ETH',
    to: 'USDC',
    amount: 1,
    chain: 'Ethereum',
  );
  print(swap.transactionHash);
}
```

Run the project with following command:
```bash
flutter run
```
