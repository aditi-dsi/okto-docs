## Installation Guide
Welcome to the first step in integrating Okto SDK into your project! This guide will walk you through the installation process and help you get started quickly.

### Prerequisites

Before installation, ensure your development environment meets these requirements:

- Node.js version 14.x or later (LTS version recommended)
- npm version 6.x or later (included with Node.js) or yarn version 1.22.x or later
- A project directory initialized with package.json

To verify your installations:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

### Installation Steps
#### 1. Create React app
Run the following commands in your terminal to create a new React app:

```bash
npx create-react-app my-okto-app
cd my-okto-app
``` 

#### 2. Install the Okto SDK
Choose one of the following commands based on your package manager:

Using npm:
```bash
npm install okto-sdk-react
```
Using yarn:
```bash
yarn install okto-sdk-react
``` 
#### 3. Verify Installation
Confirm the installation by:
1. Checking your `package.json` dependencies:
```js
{
  "dependencies": {
    "okto-sdk-react": "^x.x.x"  // Version number will vary
  }
}
```

2. Ensuring the SDK files are in your `node_modules` directory


#### 4. Initialize the project
Import the SDK into your application using either ES modules or CommonJS syntax:

```js
import { OktoProvider } from 'okto-sdk-react';
```

For CommonJS environments:

```js
const { OktoProvider } = require('okto-sdk-react');
```
#### 5. Sample Usage
```js
import { OktoProvider } from 'okto-sdk-react';

async function swapTokens() {
  const swap = await OktoProvider.swap({
    from: 'ETH',
    to: 'USDC',
    amount: 1,
    chain: 'Ethereum',
  });
  console.log(swap.transactionHash);
}
swapTokens();
```
## Next Steps
Now that you've installed the SDK successfully, you can:

1. Create your an integrated wallet experience by following the [Basic Examples](https://docs.okto.tech/docs/react-sdk/example-apps/template-app) guide
2. Explore Advanced Configuration options for customization.
3. Test your installation by creating a basic implementation.
