## Explore the Okto Ecosystem

Okto Layer is a middleware framework that simplifies Web3 user experience by abstracting the compelexities of blockchain technology and covering it through its user-friendly unified interface. This concept resulted in the development of the Okto SDK that enables developers to build seamless Web3 applications without worrying about cross-chain interoperability, liquidity fragmentation, multi-step transactions and so on.
